When reviewing the changes make sure that:
- The changes don't have obvious inconsistencies or spelling mistakes.
- If the change adds a new CIP (Canton Improvement Proposal), file README.md must be updated with the new CIP added to the table.
- "Changelog" section must be present at the bottom of the CIP text with the date and a one-liner explaining the changes.
- Values in the header (specifically: CIP (corresponds to Number in the table), Layer, Title, Author, Type and Status) of the CIP must match those in the table in the README.md
