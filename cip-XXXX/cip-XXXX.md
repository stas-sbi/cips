## Abstract

A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Specification

The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Global Synchronizer platforms.

## Motivation

The motivation is critical for CIPs that want to change the Global Synchronizer protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol is inadequate to address the problem that the CIP solves.

## Rationale

The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work. The rationale should provide evidence of consensus within the community and discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Backwards compatibility

All CIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.

## Reference implementation

The reference implementation must be completed before any CIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the CIP is accepted. It is better to finish the specification and rationale first and reach consensus on it before writing code. The final implementation must include test code and documentation appropriate for the Global Synchronizer protocol.
